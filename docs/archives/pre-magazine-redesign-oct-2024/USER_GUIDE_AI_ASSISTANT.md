## Examples of Good Conversations

### Example 1: Starting from Scratch
**You**: "I don't even know where to start."

**Guide**: "That's completely understandable. This is a big decision and it can feel overwhelming. Can you tell me a bit about what's prompting you to think about moving? Take your time - there's no rush."

**You**: "My husband passed away last year. The house feels too big now."

**Guide**: "I'm so sorry for your loss. That must be incredibly difficult. It makes sense that the house would feel different now. How long have you lived there?"

---

### Example 2: Budget Worries
**You**: "I'm on a fixed income. I don't know if I can afford this."

**Guide**: "Money is a very real concern, and it's smart that you're thinking about it. What does your budget situation look like right now? Remember, there's no judgment here - we're just thinking through what's possible."

**You**: "I get about $2,500 a month from Social Security and my pension."

**Guide**: "Thank you for sharing that. $2,500/month is your total income. How much of that feels comfortable to spend on housing, keeping in mind you'll have other expenses like food and medical costs?"

---

### Example 3: Family Pressure
**You**: "My daughter keeps pushing me to move but I'm not ready."

**Guide**: "It sounds like there might be some tension between what your daughter thinks and what you're feeling. That's common in these situations. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel you're not ready?"

**You**: "I've lived here for 40 years. All my memories are here."

**Guide**: "Forty years is a lifetime of memories. Those are precious and it makes complete sense why leaving would be so hard. What does your daughter say when you tell her you're not ready?"
